# Route Radar

Route Radar is an app meant to make using public transportation easy. Figuring out which route to use and which stop to go to can be overwhelming and difficult for someone who is not intamately familiar with the public transportation of their area. Route Radar combines data from the UGA transportation system and the Athens Clarke County transportation system into one app so users can have a centralized location for all of their transportation needs.
